## What is this repository for? ##

The purpose of this repository is to maintain control over versions of hadolint. This maintains uniformity-
when enforcing coding standards and formatting rules. This allows for easier upgrades and prevents newer versions from
breaking the pipeline.

---

## Configuration information ##

There is a '.hadolint.yaml' file containing the haolint configuration in the root of the project directory. You can
use the following YAML line to copy this into your project directory.

```shell
cp /app/.hadolint.yaml $GITHUB_WORKSPACE
```

Alternately you can use the following command to use your own configuration file.

```shell
find . \( -iname "dockerfile" or -name "*.dockerfile" \) -exec hadolint {} + -c .hadolint.yaml
```

See links below for more information about Hadolint and Alpine Linux.
